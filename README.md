# Studio On-Premise

This repository contains recipes for you to run Studio by Iterative on your own
infrastructure, using `docker-compose` or `k8s` or one of its flavors.

The guide will walk you through the preparation, customization, and basic
deployment scenarios.

## Studio components 

Studio is built from a few components:

1. UI
2. API
3. Workers
4. Services: Beat/Admin/Minio

## Prerequisites

### Minimum hardware requirements

- Memory: 4GB
- Cpu: 2
- Disk: 20Gb

### Getting the OAuth apps

In order to run Studio on premise, you'll need to setup your own GitHub or
GitLab OAuth apps and provide their credentials to Studio.

#### GitHub App

You need to create your own [GitHub App](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps) for being able to authorize on the provider side.
Redirect URI should be **${API_URL}/complete/github-app/**

**Github App scopes**:

- Contents: RW
- Issues: RW
- Metadata: R
- PullRequests: RW
- Webhooks: RW
- Email addresses: R

#### GitLab OAuth app

Please follow [the official guide](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/integration/oauth_provider.html) to set it up.  
Redirect URI should be **${API_URL}/complete/gitlab/**

Example: If you deploy to AWS, the redirect URI may look like this
`https://<FQDN>/api/complete/gitlab/`, where `<FQDN>` is the public DNS name that you can find in the instance summary.
So for example `https://ec2-3-232-133-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com/api/complete/gitlab/`

**OAuth scopes**:

- api
- email
- profile
- read_api
- read_user
- read_repository

### Bitbucket

**OAuth scopes**:

- account:email
- account:read
- projects:read
- repositories:read
- repositories:write
- pullrequests:read
- pullrequests:write
- webhooks:readandwrite

## Deployment

Studio is distributed via Iterative's private Docker registry as a set of
pre-built images.

We assume that Docker Compose and K8s will be the most common environments
Studio will be deployed to on premise.

### Deploying using Docker Compose

1. Your infrastructure needs to have
   [docker-compose v1.25 or newer](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) to
   run Studio.
2. [Login to the private registry](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/login/)
   ```
   $ docker login -u <login> -p <password> docker.iterative.ai
   ```
3. Configure `GITHUB_APP_CLIENT_ID=.. GITHUB_SECRET_KEY=.. ./install.sh` with variables
   from previous steps (or any other provider). You may also put this variables in `.env` file.  
   More info `./install --help`
4. Run `./install.sh`
5. Launch the stack `docker-compose up`

Please see [`docker-compose`](/docker-compose/) and generated `docker-compose.yaml` for more details.

Tips:
* If you specify `--url` argument during the installation, for example like this
`./install.sh --url https://ec2-3-232-133-53.compute-1.amazonaws.com`
you do not need to separately specify `UI_URL` and `API_URL` environment variables
as they will be automatically set up on ports 3000 and 8000, respectively.

### How to use custom root CA

For being able to use custom root CA you need to provide it to the containers.  
The best option is to build your custom images on top of Studio ones

**Backend**
```
FROM docker.iterative.ai/viewer_backend:latest

USER root
COPY scm_provider_root_ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
RUN cat /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt >> /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem && \
    cp /usr/local/lib/python3.10/site-packages/certifi/cacert.pem /usr/lib/ssl/cert.pem && \
    update-ca-certificates
USER dvc
```

**Frontend**
```
FROM docker.iterative.ai/viewer_ui:latest

COPY server_root_ca.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
ENV NODE_EXTRA_CA_CERTS=/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/ca.crt
```

**Install**  
For pointing custom https certificate use such command
```
./install.sh --url https://example.com \
    --tls-cert-file server.crt \
    --tls-key-file server.pem
```

**Notes**
If you are using custom root CA for your certificates you need to setup SCM provider that it could reach studio
You need to disable `SSL Verification`(not recommended) or use [trusted CA](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/integrations/webhooks.html#unable-to-get-local-issuer-certificate)
